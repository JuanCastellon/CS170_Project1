# CS170_Project1


My compiler for some reason was getting errors trying to use the vector.size function (I was using this to make sure no unnecessary duplicate states were being added to the priority queue). It was difficult to troubleshoot problems. My IDE (NetBeans) reports some issues with the implementation of priority_queues as well. The code is well-commented in the event that something is buggy. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
