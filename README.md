# CS170_Project1


My compiler for some reason was getting errors trying to use the vector.size function (I was using this to make sure no unnecessary duplicate states were being added to the priority queue). I have C++ updated in my compiler but that one function for vector just didn't seem to work when I tried running my program. It was difficult to troubleshoot problems. My IDE (NetBeans) reports some issues with the implementation of priority_queues. The code is well-commented in the event that something is buggy. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
